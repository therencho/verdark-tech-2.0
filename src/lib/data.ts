Secure Your Devices: Keep your operating system and security software up to date. Utilize strong antivirus and anti-malware protection to guard against malicious software. Beware of Social Engineering: Don't click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown senders. Be wary of unsolicited investment advice, especially through social media or email. Self-Custody vs. Exchange Wallets: Consider storing your cryptocurrency in a personal wallet that gives you complete control over your private keys.
